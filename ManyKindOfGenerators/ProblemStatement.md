# Many Kind Of Generators

### Abstract problem definition
We need a number of **generators** to produce a list of _something_, but they must work based on a set of information that needs to be collected/produced _beforehand_, in multiple steps.

### Problem definition with example
We want to generate lists of natural resources that could occur on planets. There are multiple kind of these natural resources, and in order to generate them, first we have to know some details of the planet.
